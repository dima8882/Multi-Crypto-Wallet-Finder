‚ú® Features
Dual Generation Modes: Choose between direct private key generation or BIP39 mnemonic phrase (12 words) generation

Multi-Currency Support: Simultaneously check for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) wallets

Real-time Visualization: Live updating graphs for generation speed, CPU usage, and memory consumption

Dark Theme Interface: Easy-on-the-eyes dark theme with modern UI elements

Performance Metrics: Comprehensive statistics including wallets checked, found wallets, and generation speed

Multi-threading: Utilize multiple CPU cores for maximum generation speed

Address Monitoring: Compare generated addresses against provided address lists

Prepare address files:

Place your address list files in the application directory:

btc500.txt - Bitcoin addresses

eth500.txt - Ethereum addresses

trx500.txt - Tron addresses

doge500.txt - Dogecoin addresses

Each file should contain one address per line

Run the application:

bash
python wallet_finder.py
üì¶ Dependencies
The application requires the following Python packages:

tkinter - GUI framework (usually included with Python)

ecdsa - Elliptic curve cryptography

base58 - Base58 encoding/decoding

pycryptodome - Cryptographic functions

psutil - System monitoring

matplotlib - Data visualization

mnemonic - BIP39 mnemonic generation

bip32utils - BIP32 hierarchical deterministic wallets

üéÆ Usage
Starting the Application
Launch the application using the command above

Select your preferred generation mode:

Private Key Generation: Directly generates cryptographic private keys

Mnemonic Phrase: Generates 12-word BIP39 mnemonic phrases

Configure thread count based on your CPU capabilities

Click "Start" to begin the search process

Monitor real-time statistics and graphs

Click "Stop" to pause the search at any time

Understanding the Interface
Statistics Panel: Shows current search metrics including wallets checked, speed, and found wallets

System Metrics: Displays CPU and memory usage along with active thread count

Real-time Generation: Shows the most recently generated addresses for each cryptocurrency

Performance Graphs: Visualizes generation speed, CPU usage, and memory consumption over time

Log Panel: Provides detailed information about the search process and any found wallets

Output Files
When a matching wallet is found, the application saves details to corresponding files:

BTCWinner.txt - Found Bitcoin wallets

EthWinner.txt - Found Ethereum wallets

TRXWinner.txt - Found Tron wallets

DogeWinner.txt - Found Dogecoin wallets

Each file contains the private key, address, and discovery timestamp.

üîß Configuration
Thread Optimization
For optimal performance, set the thread count based on your processor:

For 4-core CPUs: 4-8 threads

For 8-core CPUs: 8-16 threads

Adjust based on your system's response

Address Lists
The application checks generated addresses against the provided text files. You can:

Use the included sample files with 500 addresses each

Replace with your own address lists

Create custom lists from blockchain explorers

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
This tool is for educational purposes only

The probability of finding a wallet with funds is extremely low

Always use legally obtained address lists

Keep your results secure if you do find anything valuable

The application does not connect to any blockchain networks; it only performs local comparisons

Extending the Application
To add support for additional cryptocurrencies:

Implement address generation functions following existing patterns

Add corresponding address list file

Update the UI to display the new currency

Modify the thread function to check the new address type

üìä Performance Tips
Close other resource-intensive applications while running

Use SSD storage for faster file operations

Monitor system temperature during extended runs

Adjust thread count based on your specific hardware
